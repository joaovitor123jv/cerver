## Disclaimers

- This is intended to be a HTTP server, but it is not yet.
- This code is NOT finished, and will not produce any HTTP server by now.
- I am building the initial structure yet, turning possible to run tests and
  implementing data structures.
- For a working alternative of this project, please check
  [Cpperver](https://github.com/joaovitor123jv/cpperver).
- This is a project made "for fun", and I am not responsible for any damage
  caused by this code.
- This library is intended to be a stand-alone, and will not depend on any
  other library except the one provided by the operating system.
- This is a C project. The Cpperver project is another, independent project
  written in C++.
